1,5,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level.

13,5,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",upgraded cpu heavy research ask reddit intel amd subreddits weigh money

21,5,"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler.

Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming.

332,5,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.

347,5,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern.

I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap.

351,4,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.

The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1.

356,5,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit.

357,5,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",finally upgraded home workstation go new i914900k incredibly fast davinci resolve video project file render old setup i76850k take 22 minute complete render new i9 exact file export take 8 minute almost 3x speed increase also speed footage resolve old cpu could play back smoothly would jump chug like crazy new i9 play back speed 800 problem actually see look without export entire video clip see playback retimed footage smoothly application open u p much faster could due pcie40 nvme system drive much faster previous version nvme old build one thing like new cpu number pci lane get 20 16 pcie50 4 pcie40 wont issue people old cpu 40 lane allow run 3 gpus time yes need use gpu render software use 8 gpus one system one license every additional gpu speed render time lot render 3d sims new cpu run 2 gpus run 8x cause share 16x leave 4 full pcie40 lane system drive deal breaker increase speed overall well worth one thing everybody aware new intel chip p core e core something old cpu ecores severely impact certain software performance boot new machine try ableton daw first time expect happy performance boost software literally almost unusable ecores slow software bad could barely change setting preference bad install process lasso fantastic software free never heard disable use ecores ableton work fast great,2,positive,"{'resolve': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3818}, 'increase': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'play': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.34}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'crazy': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}, 'problem': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'number': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0772}, 'allow': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'yes': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'share': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.296}, 'leave': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.0516}, 'well': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'worth': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'severely': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4588}, 'certain': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'happy': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5719}, 'boost': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'bad': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423}, 'fantastic': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5574}, 'free': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5106}, 'great': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.6249}}",2,2

368,3,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.

Instead, compared to 13900k, always reviewed here on Amazon, I didn't want to intervene from the BIOS also because after the first minutes in stress tests, forExample with Cinebench 23, during which the BIOS always pushes the processor to the limit (over 360 watts), everything calms down.The boost lasts a few moments and immediately after consumption stands on the 253 watts, consequently even the temperatures drop, so much so that the average ones of the cores hardly exceed 90 degrees (in the 10 min test) ⚖️ The processor offers really excellent performance,All programs run smoothly like oil, thanks also to the 64 GB of memory.The Adobe Suite, from Photoshop to After Effects, from Illustrator to Premiere Pro, Blender, 4D Cinema and Metashape Pro (i.e. the programs that I use most) are supported by so much power and have no hesitation.Also with several applications open on 13700K, it works largely .🚀 On Cinebench R23 the score is 28550 on the single render, maximum temperatures of the core 4, 5 and 7 (the most hot) of 100 ° while in the 10 min test of 10 min the scoreIt was 27497 with maximum temperatures of 100 ° respectively for Core 3, 5 and 7c.A difference in only 3.69 % between the single render and the Throttling test.Not bad! In the Throttling test of 10 min, the maximum values of the individual cores vary between 93 ° and 100 °, while the average ones between 83 ° -85 °, therefore more than acceptable.The maximum consumption is 351 watts while the average ones 260 watts. In idle the temperatures vary between 21 ° and 47 °. You can check from the photos 😬.

Even the interior of the package remained practically the same tradition / philosophy, where the processor in itself is contained within a container ofplastic, which in turn, is blocked by the cardboard of the package, so as to avoid a possible fall during the shipment of the article, moreover, since the external structure made of cardboard but the plastic part placed only in the center, it seals any bumps duringtransportation is also supplied the classic manual with adhesive attached to your homes with this new series, or 13 esimo.Description of the article by a series 9, more precisely i7-9700k this i7-13700k series can only be aI definitely pass forward.In fact, my previous processor presented 8 cores and 8 threads instead of this which has 16 cores and 24 threads.In addition, it can be defined as a processor divided as there are 8 core performances (P-core) and 8 efficient cores (e-core).The former can reach a maximum speed of 5.4 GHz, while the efficient core 4.2 GHz.The basic frequency with regard to the efficient cores is 2.5 GHz.The basic power of the processor is 125W but can reach 253W in turbo. Obviously the management whether to use the efficient or power cores is given by the operating system and by the workload that is required.If the bios is equipped with it (like mine in this case) it is in fact possible to deactivate e-cores or always bring them to their maximum speed.However, I strongly advise against doing this soft-AVERCLLUK as with these new generation processors is completely ""useless"" given the monstrous performance that they manage to offer, so as to avoid going to compromise their reliability.In fact, I personally contested that on very heavy games and areas, automatic management is absolutely perfect, allowing really low work temperatures and a truly remarkable surrender.) with FPS blocked at 75, the latter never fall under this threshold but on the contrary, they tend to increase slightly.With the previous configuration there were multiple drops in frames. The same I had the opportunity to ascertain it on a competitive game, as can be fortnite, blocking the FPS to 144 and the latter remain stable on this threshold without ever falling and without precisely, thatThe minimum lag that would be deleterious on a game where the speed is fundamental. The work that has been done on these new CPUs is simply remarkable, I was really surprised by the speed in doing the operations since it is really very fast to do everything, but especially surprises on the performance that occur on the gaming side.I add that my tests are performed on the last building 22h2 of Windows 11.Conclusioniin conclusion, I consider myself absolutely satisfied with this processor.I also want to emphasize that all my tests were carried out with a ""dated"" RAM by only 2667 MHz.For this processor, in fact, a frequency of at least 3200 MHz is recommended as regards the DDR4 and obviously supports the DDR5 RAM widely that reach even higher speeds compared to the previous series.Tuttavia, despite this ""problem"", since it is not a problem, thePerformance that I had the opportunity to ascertain through benchmark are respectable. Obviously being a new processor just released, you will have to wait a little before Windows in particular, it is updated to the best to fully exploit the power offered by this processor.At the same time, it is really difficult to find one at a fair price.In my case, considering that my previous processor broke, I had to find a quick replacement immediately.Paid about 500 euros (a little less), I

Any recent video game manages the cores without problems and the processor itself ""turns off"" those not necessary for the'performed activity.Even with those games that require high -end hardware as a suggested requirement for an optimal experience, this CPU falls abundantly in the list - and it will do so for a long time. For the title of comparison my old Intel I7-3700 has been able to hold upand start without problems any video game that came out from 2013 to today without ever slowing down or warming further measure and I have no doubt that with this modern and updated version it is the same. A small thing to pay attention to: the CPU warms up.It is not its flaw but its operating temperature especially after hours of gaming.Get ready for its premature departure if cooled inadequately and/or inserted in small houses.My model was not a garage (therefore sold without fan) and I turned to a well-known brand famous in the industry for the purchase of the dedicated fan.In the conclusion perhaps I obtained the same performances also with a CPU of the I5-135XX family who haveAlways a good quality/price ratio, but I wanted to exaggerate to be calm with the specifications of the games to come.

Finally, it is that, for the same hardware, I had the opportunity to test with Cinebench R23 both i7 processors-13700 and i7-13700K (at the stock frequency).

596,5,"UPDATE - After over 8 months of use - This is truly an awesome processor! With the hyper threading capabilities this quad core does a surprisingly awesome job in Autocad and Inventor (2D and 3D design), as well as web and app development/coding, and some video editing projects; which is primarily what I use this computer for.With this work load I was tempted to fork over the extra money to buy a 6 core i7-6800k or i7-6850k and move to the X-99 platform. As that seems to be the recommended route of most tech review Youtubers for my use. But being on a budget at the time I went for the Z170 platform. Now I can confidently say that I made a good choice, and my system performance is amazing. I never hit serious bottle-necks where my CPU is holding me back.I also do some light gaming and with my EVGA GTX 960 ACX 2.0 FTW 4GB and I get great 1080p performance. Although I do have an i5-6600k system with a GTX 980 Ti 6GB that I use far more for gaming, and it has better in game performance than this system. I’d recommend to those looking to buy this CPU and who plan to primarily use their system for gaming to go with a i5-6600k or the new i5-7600k at the most. Especially if you’re on a budget, I think it's a bit overkill to go with an i7. As pretty much all gaming experiences aren't as limited by CPU's, but instead by GPU performance. I would spend the money saved buying an i5 on a better graphics card. But if you can afford the i7 with a great GPU then definitely go for it, this advice is for those who are building on a budget. As gaming is not my primary use at all for this build I did not spend much on my GPU but just got a good value card and spent the extra money to buy this i7-6700k.I've water-cooled this processor with the Cooler Master MasterLiquid Pro 240 and am overclocked at 4.7GHz at 1.360V. I never have any thermal throttling or system stability issues. After 4 hours of stress testing on Aida64 I had an average CPU temperature of 69 degrees C. So for those looking to overclock this CPU I definitely would recommend a 240mm AIO CPU cooler. Or at least a big air cooled heat sink. When I first built this system I was using the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO, (which is an amazing cooler) but without any overclocking I was hitting even higher temps in day-to-day use than I'm hitting now; even with the 4.7GHz overclock. Overall this is arguably the best 4 core CPU you can buy and I'm very pleased with his purchase!To those looking to upgrade from the SkyLake i7-6700k to the KabyLake i7-7700k there is really no need. Yes the overclocking potential is higher on the new i7, but, when compared at the same frequency both processors are nearly identical and have the same core-to-core performance. Same goes with the SkyLake i5-6600k and KabyLake i5-7600k.If anyone has questions feel free to ask!

I don't really intend to overclock as I find it handles everything I can throw at it at present - but if any future game releases need a bit more power I will have the option to do so over the standard 6700 and it was only a few £'s more to buy!Paired with a Z170 chipset this makes for a very powerful and responsive pc, and editing video so much faster than my previous setup. After a 4 hour Fallout 4 gaming session the temperature barely went over 27 degrees celcius so that's also pleasing and I no longer get to hear any cooling fans!With the forthcoming Kaby Lake processors being released, this model may drop in price and make it even more of a bargain for those looking to upgrade to Skylake. I did look at holding off for the Kaby Lake but the improvements over this processor (mainly clock speed) were very small and as I use a graphics card over the iGPU it became less attractive to me.

601,5,"For the price you cannot go wrong with this.  The only issue that I found was that the number of PCIe lanes described in the documentation for this CPU was not enough for what I wanted.  The specs say it has 16 lanes, but my video card alone needs 16 lanes. Plus I have an M.2 hard drive that needs 4.  I almost didn't buy it, and went with a different CPU and motherboard.  But, I did some more research and found that these are just the lanes in the CPU, and the bridge chip has its own lanes.  These lanes are really intended for the graphics card only.  So, if you look how the motherboard is setup, these 16 lanes go to the first x16 slot intended for a video card.  That is how mine is.  Then the skylake chipset that is paired with this CPU has 20 more lanes.  That is enough for another x16 card, and a x4 M.2 hard drive or whatever.  So, you actually end up with 36 lanes of PCIe between the two. Once I saw that, there was no question this is for me.It is a 14nm process, which is one of the newer processes, and it runs at 4Ghz,  The CPU is unlocked, so you can overclock if you want.  I put on a water cooler and just did some brief checks with OC, and I ran at 4.5Ghz without issue.  However, I really don't need it and I don't want to risk burning it out fast, so I put it back to 4Ghz for now.  But, I know I can run much faster in the future if I want to.As for specs and performance, this is a middle of the road 4 core, 8 thread CPU.  It has the memory controller built in, supporting DDR4 memory, which is what I use, and the performance is just staggering.  >34GB/s of memory throughput, that's wild.The CPU has 8MB of smartcache that is shared amongst the cores.  This is much better than normal cache, it allows a program in cache to be shared with another core, when the thread jumps to a new core, without copying the data to another location in cache.  The performance increase of this small feature is quite large.  The CPU has a decent video card built in, but I don't use it.  I opted for the Nvidia GTX1080.  Combining this CPU with that graphics card, M.2 drive, and DDR4 memory makes this a powerhouse that can stand its own against basically anything.  However, the built in graphics do support 4K resolutions, so if you are not playing cutting edge games, or VR, the graphics card built in is probably all you would ever need.Without going into the technical specifics of this CPU, it basically has all the features that you would expect from any i7 CPU.  The price, for what you get, is really unbeatable.  You can get an i7 with more cores, or cache, but you will pay a large amount more.  For 99.99% of people out there this is more than you will need.  There is nothing you will get from the CPUs that are 2X+ the price that you will even notice.  Just make sure you pair this with a good chipset, like the Z170, and never look back, you will run so fast you won't believe it.My PC runs windows 10.  From the time the BIOS screen disappears to when it needs my password is about 3.5 seconds.  From hitting enter after my password until the machine is fully booted, and I have full control, no hourglass, etc, is about 2-2.5 seconds.  So, I boot in under 6 seconds, basically.  That is a full cold boot, not a resume from sleep.Pros: 4Ghz, unlocked and ready for overclocking (use a water cooler if you overclock this bad-boy).  4K graphics built in.  16 lanes of PCIe on board for fast access to the video card.  20 more lanes of PCIe on the chipset, so you can have another 16x video card, and a M.2 x4 drive, or whatever else you might want.  New generation cache speeds up thread jumping from core to core.  DDR4 memory controller with >34GB/s throughput.  The biggest PRO is the price, for what you get.Cons: Would have been nice to have 12MB or more of cache, but the cost would have been significantly more.  For the price, there is really no downside to this CPU.",price go wrong issue found number pcie lane described documentation cpu enough want spec say 16 lane video card alone need 16 lane plus m2 hard drive need 4 almost didnt buy go different cpu motherboard research found lane cpu bridge chip lane lane really intend graphic card look motherboard setup 16 lane go first x16 slot intend video card mine skylake chipset pair cpu 20 lane enough another x16 card x4 m2 hard drive whatever actually end 36 lane pcie two saw question meit 14nm process one newer process run 4ghz cpu unlocked overclock want put water cooler brief check oc ran 45ghz without issue however really dont need dont want risk burning fast put back 4ghz know run much faster future want toas spec performance middle road 4 core 8 thread cpu memory controller built support ddr4 memory use performance stagger 34gbs memory throughput thats wildthe cpu 8mb smartcache share amongst core much well normal cache allows program cache share another core thread jump new core without copying data another location cache performance increase small feature quite large cpu decent video card built dont use opt nvidia gtx1080 combine cpu graphic card m2 drive ddr4 memory make powerhouse stand basically anything however built graphic support 4k resolution play cut edge game vr graphic card built probably would ever needwithout go technical specific cpu basically feature would expect i7 cpu price get really unbeatable get i7 core cache pay large amount 9999 people need nothing get cpu 2x price even notice make sure pair good chipset like z170 never look back run fast wont believe itmy pc run window 10 time bios screen disappears need password 35 second hit enter password machine fully boot full control hourglass etc 225 second boot 6 second basically full cold boot resume sleeppros 4ghz unlocked ready overclocking use water cooler overclock badboy 4k graphic built 16 lane pcie board fast access video card 20 lane pcie chipset another 16x video card m2 x4 drive whatever else might want new generation cache speed thread jumping core core ddr4 memory controller 34gbs throughput big pro price getcons would nice 12mb cache cost would significantly price really downside cpu,2,positive,"{'wrong': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767}, 'number': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0772}, 'want': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0772}, 'alone': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.25}, 'hard': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027}, 'risk': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2732}, 'support': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'share': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.296}, 'well': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'increase': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'play': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.34}, 'cut': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2732}, 'pay': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027}, 'sure': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'good': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4404}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'disappears': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}, 'ready': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'nice': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4215}, 'downside': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.25}}",2,2

Reportedly the golden overclock for this CPU is 4.5ghz, though I have seen several users report having stable over clocks at close to 5ghz.The 6700k also supports DDR4, this was the big draw- if not the only draw for a lot of Haswell CPU users to upgrade.

I completed the build about 3 weeks ago, and I gotta say, OCing this chip manually, I settled on a 4.5 Ghz @ a cool 1.25V with headroom given the new 1000W platinum certified PSU I have with a delicious 12V rail.  I messed around and got to a ""17%"" overclock according to ASUS' BIOS by getting the chip up to 4.7GHZ @ 1.42V. via OCCT, but crashed about 5 minutes in.  Some room for improvement, but with a premium cooler (I prefer liquid) and a top shelf thermal paste, temps are a chilly 26°C on idle, 45°C on gaming load, and 60°-65°C on stressing levels (4.5Ghz, mind you).The only con I have of this chip is that it doesn't cook me breakfast!  *gigglesnort*  Seriously though, if you have the means and the desire, get this CPU and you will not regret it.At the end of the day, to each their own.

Untarakantara"" seems to have to buy Windows10 from this CPU.Furthermore, we looked at the reviews, ""I changed from quad to 6700K, and the electricity bill was reduced by about 2500 yen a month"", ""4K compatible"", ""General graphics are equivalent to the old GeForce"", and ""Replace this GW.""It's up.Unfortunately, the M2 I bought at Amazon was initially defective and the GW was gone when it was time to confirm the defective product.The previous CPU is Q8200, which is a comparison from those that were OC about 200MHz in 2010.The numerical value is not measured, and it will be a review with experience.The temperature is low when idle.If you move gas gas, it will be much hotter than the Q8200.However, since the processing is fast, it is not hot forever.It is always hot if you do something that can not catch up with a high load game, so it may be better to consider the flow of the PC case.(Pay about the temperature is that the HDD is weak to the temperature) If you do not put a high load, it is a CPU that does not have to pay attention to the temperature.OC, but I tried a little.It worked at 4.2GHz without any pain.(4.7GHz at the boost) I think that the voltage setting on the memory side is essential because the memory does not catch up.I'm not trying the limits, but I don't want that much, so it's enough for me.I think that the rating is enough, so if you do not OC, there is no K.Probably, but on the yield, it is a waste to throw it away with Freqtest, so there is no K, and there is a feeling that it was sold with K for good things.It may be that the image of ""K"" can be attached, but both are not a problem as a product, so it is good to judge whether or not money is affordable.I will try to use it at 4GHz and use it with 3200MHz memory for a while.I can't evaluate because it is a visceral graphic, but I don't have a 4K display.Because I'm FFXI, there.The default of the mother is only 32m, so let's set the upper limit of 1024m.In addition, the utility on the mother often makes the screen strange, so let's install a new driver.My mother was made of ASUS, so it is stable using the latest driver v20.19.15.4377 on the site.By the way, the FFXI condition is more lighter than the GeForce9600GT I have used.When the effect overlaps, is it about ""n?""It's an old game, so I don't care if I'm solo.It seems to be close to GeForce9600GT (about 7800?).The visceral graphic was improved so much.How fast it is, encoding, but it took about 40 minutes to convert a 25 -minute program to MP4, about 8 minutes.It is power consumption, but I do not know because I do not have a measurement device.Even if the CPU itself doesn't eat electricity, I can't say anything because the mother I bought this time seems to eat electricity unplanned.Let's report that area someday.If you are looking for more high-spec, why not consider the Broadwell-E of 10 cores and 20 threads?Well, there is a problem of how much multi -core -compatible software

I installed it almost as soon as I got it.To prelude, my home doesn't have traditional AC, but a bunch of ceiling fans to circulate air. A-Frame houses are difficult to temperature control, so the summers get pretty hot. CPU temperatures mean a lot to me. For reference, my ambient temps are between 75-80F, since it's summer.I upgraded from a slightly-overclocked Nehalem i7 950. The least I can say is, my computer no longer heats up my room. My 950 saw temps between 30-50c on idle, and this is on Noctua's beastly NH-D15. Whether or not there was something wrong with my CPU/Cooler is up for debate, but I've tried multiple cooling solutions, the best being the NH-D15. With the 6700K, my temps shot down to 18-25c on idle. My mouth dropped when I saw those temps. I am interested how the temps fare during the winter.My hardest-working, CPU-strangling program at the moment is Guild Wars 2. It's funny when you can actually FEEL the difference between the processors. I am getting FPS in situations where there were no FPS before, and plenty of them. Performance doubled everywhere for me. My old CPU ran hot while GW2 was running, and I saw temps between 48-68c, which totally raised the temperature in my room--by a lot. Now, I see 35-50c, and for the first time, my computer doesn't feel like it's suffering.I know it seems like I am writing a review for the NH-D15, but I wanted to point out the overall difference I noticed upgrading from a 6-year old processor.

640,5,"Switched to this from an AMD 6350 overclocked to 4.5GHz and even at a stock clock, this processor smashes my old one.  I bled AMD for so long, but their performance is just garbage, and considering if I had upgraded to a new AMD chip, I would have had to build a whole new system from the start.  I decided on Intel this time, and I picked this up for under 300 (I knew the 7700K's were coming within a month) this chip was still so much an upgrade.  I played around with overclocking a little bit and I can hit 4.3GHz stable without changing voltage, but I'll save that for a quick, free upgrade later.My old processors would cause random stuttering and unsteady frame rates, moving to this fixed my issue.  There are still drops, but they aren't as dramatic and not as frequent.*update* Months later, this is still going great.  AMD has released their Ryzen chips, and for $100 more than what I paid for this, the 1800x would give me approximately 0.1% increase overall.  The Ryzen 1800x is a 8 core 16 thread processor, but if you're gaming, the higher clock speed matters a little more.  If you want the newest equivalent of this chip, the 7700K is currently about Three hundred and offers roughly an 11% increase over the 1800x, for a hundred bucks less. Information taken from userbenchmark dot com.  For gaming, higher clock speeds win, for multi-threaded tasking and server management, more cores and threads can help.  I still have plenty of room to overclock this chip in the future, and I can gain the ground lost by the newest generation of processors for a few years in doing so.

The bottlenecks are gone now as this CPU is superfast and tears up pretty much anything I can through at it.I did perform the check for the recently reported fma3 bug, per this PC World article. I am happy to report that mine does not have this issue. As for cooling, I went with a Corsair liquid cooler, given the cost was about the same for a quiet air cooling unit from Noctua.Other thoughts, I was tempted to go I5 again but realized that I would probably hit the same bottlenecks again. I also looked at the non-K version of this chip and decided to get the K version, even if I decide not to overclock. My thoughts were that this 6700k chip is already a higher clock than the i7-6700 so why not just get the processor already binned as being a higher quality chip? I am glad a chose it, despite the extra cost.Also, upgrading from Haswell to Skylake certainly is worth it from a motherboard perspective. Getting USB 3.1, DDR4, and M2 support just makes sense.

Do NOT abuse this amazing CPU with an air cooler – you'll be very happy you chose water cooling.With my Corsair H105 cooler, I managed to clock all cores at 5.0GHz with +220-250mV offset, and run the benchmark you see attatched.  Temps run in the low-mid 70s C under full load @ 5.0GHz.  It handled a 20-minute stress test without crashing, so I consider it decently stable at this freqency, although more abusive testing may be needed to confirm a 100% stable voltage.I was able to achieve and run some tests at 5.07 GHz, but stability isn't great, and 5.10 GHz runs into current limits on my motherboard that I haven't found out how to disable (or whether it's even safe) to push this thing harder.

655,5,This was the replacement for my old i5-3570K rig. The last time I had an 8 threaded processor was way back with the first generation of i7 chips with the i7-960; boy is it good to be back. Out of the box the processor is clocked at 4GHz but after five minutes I had it running at 4.8GHz. This is the easiest overclock-able processor I've ever owned. It sips on power (I've only got 1.3V on the core and I am sure I can get it lower) and on an H100i V2 under synthetic load the max temperature after 30 minutes straight was 58C. Every single thing I threw at this processor was creamed.

671,1,"My son asked me last month if he could get a new processor for his birthday (May 27).  I told him that if I bought him one, that it would be his only present because of how expensive it was. He said he was ok with just opening 1 gift (mind you, he just turned 12). So after a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that the Intel 7 was the best processor for his PC. I ordered the item on May 13 and received it a couple days later. I didn't open the amazon box because I already knew what was in it. On May 27, 2019, my 12 year old son opened his only gift. To my surprise, the processor wasn't in the Intel 7 box that is shown in the description. Instead the processor was wrapped in brown paper. No instruction, no serial number, no fan, nothing. But I didn't really care about the fan because I had already purchased a better one. So, giving the product/company the benefit of the doubt, I installed the processor I ordered into my son's PC. And what should happen, nothing. I spent the rest of the evening researching why the processor wasn't working in his PC. But I didn't find anything on line that had the same problem as I was having. So, I decided to update the BIOS thinking that would make a difference, but it didn't. I even called my friend (who builds computers) to come look at it. After spending the evening researching, he said that everything was compatable and that there shouldn't be any reason the new processor shouldn't work, UNLESS there was something already wrong with the processor that I bought. He then recommended that I return it. I just filed a return claim.

729,5,"I got this to replace a 6 core Broadwell CPU. They are pin compatible, but I forgot to upgrade my BIOS before I had the CPU installed. Luckily, EVGA furnished a BIOS chip for free, and replacing the original BIOS was simple. For some, unknown reason, probably user induced, the OS couldn't find the boot device after I installed the BIOS so I had to reinstall Windows, etc. I have a gadget that displays the cores and virtual cores, so its pretty neat to see 16 cores. I haven't done any testing to push it to its limits, but for my applications, it idles along at 2 or 3% and kills my 4 core laptop in doing the same things.I was anxious to see how it performed on the Windows User Experience index. My Broadwell came in at 7.8; I was expecting to thoroughly peg 7.9. Unfortunately, the best I can tell, the CPU has more cache on it than the User Experience Index software can handle. Every time I ran the test, I got a Memory Tuning error, and the process would quit. Broadwell CPUs had the same problem, which was caused by ""too much"" cache, and Service Pack 1 fixed the problem. I have SP 1 in, and the problem persists.Its been a while since I had my Broadwell CPU installed, and used a 4 core laptop in between, and all opinions are strictly subjective, but this CPU in the same chassis, with everything but the cooler, and the socket the video card is in, are the same, and the Haswell seems noticeably faster than the Broadwell.I got this on a significant discount; a 10 core Haswell would have been close to twice the price of what I paid for this 8 core beast. I'm expecting great things with it when I get my FSX:Steam reinstalled.I have an EVGA X99 Classified MB. It comes with several utilities, including E-Leet, which is a Windows based over-clocking utility. Actually, it's better than using the BIOS. I even saw the multiplier optimization work. The hotter cores get a lower default multiplier, but E-Leet allows you to modify them.
