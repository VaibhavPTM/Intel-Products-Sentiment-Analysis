If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling.

34,5,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s.

The packaging is simple, no irrelevant information and has an appealing effect on me.The processor was added with a boxed cooler, i.e. directly with a suitable air cooler.Using the mainboard is very simple and the feel is very appealing.As always, the product name and the clock frequency is shown on the processor.

Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform.

758,5,"I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it.

771,5,"I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4.Pros:More coresNoticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications.Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most).CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction.Cons:If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 it’s nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of.Heat- I’m running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load.Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo.Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really don’t need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.

I had not updated my computer since Kaby Lake... and I was a bit disappointed to see how thrashed Intel was getting by AMD.Luckily it was finally time to upgrade and my old system was dying... I had many things failing which was due to poor storage of the system while I was moving.These new 12th gen chips are blazing fast, and the prices are actually super competitive... also you can actually find them!  Originally, I was going to go with an AMD build this time - but finding the chips was getting harder and they were getting pricey.  Who would have thought that Intel was finally on the cheaper side of the competition!?This installed without any issues in my ASUS PRIME Motherboard, and was detected just fine, RAM was also no issue there either.

1030,5,Amazing CPU handles everything I throw at it with ease and I'm able to run everything smoothly.I would like to add that for some weird reason windows wasn't using all cores and I suspected that I received the wrong one. In order to utilize all cores and use them to their max potential you need to make sure they are first of all enabled in the bios and only after that in windows you need to go to msconfig.msc > boot > advanced options > and uncheck the box with number of processors. This is very important otherwise windows will pretend that you don't have a 10 core CPU and give you false info under system info. and make sure to reboot for this to take effect. and when you do that windows will show that you have 10 cores CPU but still doesn't mean they are all in use. Download a software called QuickCPU and then change the power plan to high performance and at the bottom set everything to 100% and click apply. Once that is done congrats windows will use all the cores to their limit.,amaze cpu handle everything throw ease im able run everything smoothlyi would like add weird reason window wasnt use core suspect receive wrong one order utilize core use max potential need make sure first enable bios window need go msconfigmsc boot advanced option uncheck box number processor important otherwise window pretend dont 10 core cpu give false info system info make sure reboot take effect window show 10 core cpu still doesnt mean use download software call quickcpu change power plan high performance bottom set everything 100 click apply do congrats window use core limit,2,positive,"{'amaze': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5423}, 'ease': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'weird': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1779}, 'suspect': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296}, 'wrong': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767}, 'sure': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'advanced': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.25}, 'number': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0772}, 'important': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2023}, 'pretend': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027}, 'congrats': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5267}}",2,2

1168,5,"Hello,So I bought this processor to replace my ryzen 7 2700x that finally decided to die on me. I have had the ryzen since launch.I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen.

is a technology in which the CPU operator (recently 256 to 512 -bit) is subdivided into a variable type (8-64bit), and the calculation is parallel.In AVX256, 8 -bit variables are calculated in 32 parallel, but AVX512 can calculate in 64 parallel.The recent performance of the CPU is almost determined by the speed of the AVX instruction.In particular, the speed of the video encoding and generated AI appears in the superiority of the AVX instruction.Intel has a fast AVX order since Haswell Refresh (4th generation), and it is strong in video conversion, and when idle is down to about 700MHz (Ryzen is about 1.4GHz at most), it is good to have high power saving performance.hey.However, if the power limit does not work at all, it will have a hard time cooling.The CPU cooler for TDP65W drops to about 3.0GHz with the thermal slot ring.Still, it is a big deal because the above performance comes out.If you attach a fine CPU cooler, it will always move around 4.0GHz.This is the second generation of P-CORE (single performance specialization) and E-Core (efficiency and multi-performance), which are good at Intel, who makes a wide range of CPUs from ATOM to Xeon.The production process (NM value) tends to be delayed to AMD and ARM, but I think Intel is still excellent in architecture and instruction sets.If you switch from the Tiger Lake (11th generation) below, the performance is not a dream, so you are amazed at the advancement of technology.The built -in GPU is 32 executed units (80 i5 1135g7 of Tiger Lake), so it should be divisible as a bonus.If you are willing to play a little game, add the video card.However, it is convenient to be able to output a monitor without a video card.Recently, even the i5 costs 35,000 yen due to the depreciation of the yen.In the past, I could buy i7 at the same price.。。Recently, the discount mazabo of about 5,000 yen is gone, and it is cheap and costs 15,000 yen, so it is a 50,000 yen course with CPU+Mazabo

However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender.

This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.

is a technology in which the CPU operator (recently 256 to 512 -bit) is subdivided into a variable type (8-64bit), and the calculation is parallel.In AVX256, 8 -bit variables are calculated in 32 parallel, but AVX512 can calculate in 64 parallel.The recent performance of the CPU is almost determined by the speed of the AVX instruction.In particular, the speed of the video encoding and generated AI appears in the superiority of the AVX instruction.Intel has a fast AVX order since Haswell Refresh (4th generation), and it is strong in video conversion, and when idle is down to about 700MHz (Ryzen is about 1.4GHz at most), it is good to have high power saving performance.hey.However, if the power limit does not work at all, it will have a hard time cooling.The CPU cooler for TDP65W drops to about 3.0GHz with the thermal slot ring.Still, it is a big deal because the above performance comes out.If you attach a fine CPU cooler, it will always move around 4.0GHz.This is the second generation of P-CORE (single performance specialization) and E-Core (efficiency and multi-performance), which are good at Intel, who makes a wide range of CPUs from ATOM to Xeon.The production process (NM value) tends to be delayed to AMD and ARM, but I think Intel is still excellent in architecture and instruction sets.If you switch from the Tiger Lake (11th generation) below, the performance is not a dream, so you are amazed at the advancement of technology.The built -in GPU is 32 executed units (80 i5 1135g7 of Tiger Lake), so it should be divisible as a bonus.If you are willing to play a little game, add the video card.However, it is convenient to be able to output a monitor without a video card.Recently, even the i5 costs 35,000 yen due to the depreciation of the

1611,4,Processor is Great without any doubt. Work like a charm. I used i7 6700k before and this i3 12100f is powerful than that at 1/4th of the price. I'm happy with the purchase.
