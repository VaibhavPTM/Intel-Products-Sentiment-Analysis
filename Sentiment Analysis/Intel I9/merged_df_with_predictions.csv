5,3,"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS.

27,5,"So I am no tech guru or anything.  I cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can.  What I can tell you is this.  The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity.  Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work.  Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well.  I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it.

47,3,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.",first thing first genuinely powerful cpu thats able handle basically every task ive thrown run demand task like encode game easenow way thermal thing get hot mean really hot youre go air cool strongly recommend double tower sixeight pipe air cooler like corsair a115 cooler master ma824 go aio route anything less 360mm aio perform go 360mm aio brand choice space go 420mm aio best resultsfinally recent report cpu degradation instability use cpu use asus rog strix z790h motherboard basically juiced cpu like tomorrow apply intels power setting cpu likely cause degradation sure check intels website recommend power setting also check motherboard vendor bios update intel confirm many motherboard vendor run i9 13900k cpu intels specificationsin conclusion here personal experience cpu function use asus ai overclocking feature get bsod clockwatchdogtimeout error apps randomly crash probably shouldnt use ai assist overclocking feature help even run stock still substantial amount performance cpu old rig look upgrade cpu would wait meteorlake go amdfinal note use contact frame motherboard cpu,1,positive,"{'powerful': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4215}, 'demand': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'cool': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'strongly': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'recommend': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'best': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.6369}, 'degradation': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5267}, 'sure': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'bsod': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4939}, 'error': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'crash': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'help': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'substantial': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2023}, 'rig': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}}",2,1

Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.

They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.

118,5,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.

122,5,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",finally upgraded home workstation go new i914900k incredibly fast davinci resolve video project file render old setup i76850k take 22 minute complete render new i9 exact file export take 8 minute almost 3x speed increase also speed footage resolve old cpu could play back smoothly would jump chug like crazy new i9 play back speed 800 problem actually see look without export entire video clip see playback retimed footage smoothly application open u p much faster could due pcie40 nvme system drive much faster previous version nvme old build one thing like new cpu number pci lane get 20 16 pcie50 4 pcie40 wont issue people old cpu 40 lane allow run 3 gpus time yes need use gpu render software use 8 gpus one system one license every additional gpu speed render time lot render 3d sims new cpu run 2 gpus run 8x cause share 16x leave 4 full pcie40 lane system drive deal breaker increase speed overall well worth one thing everybody aware new intel chip p core e core something old cpu ecores severely impact certain software performance boot new machine try ableton daw first time expect happy performance boost software literally almost unusable ecores slow software bad could barely change setting preference bad install process lasso fantastic software free never heard disable use ecores ableton work fast great,2,positive,"{'resolve': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3818}, 'increase': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'play': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.34}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'crazy': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}, 'problem': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'number': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0772}, 'allow': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'yes': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'share': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.296}, 'leave': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.0516}, 'well': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'worth': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'severely': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4588}, 'certain': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'happy': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5719}, 'boost': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'bad': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423}, 'fantastic': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5574}, 'free': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5106}, 'great': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.6249}}",2,2

I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.

If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it!

The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler.

I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit.

153,3,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.

One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap.

I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor.

218,5,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster.

As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight.

318,5,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.

322,5,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",finally upgraded home workstation go new i914900k incredibly fast davinci resolve video project file render old setup i76850k take 22 minute complete render new i9 exact file export take 8 minute almost 3x speed increase also speed footage resolve old cpu could play back smoothly would jump chug like crazy new i9 play back speed 800 problem actually see look without export entire video clip see playback retimed footage smoothly application open u p much faster could due pcie40 nvme system drive much faster previous version nvme old build one thing like new cpu number pci lane get 20 16 pcie50 4 pcie40 wont issue people old cpu 40 lane allow run 3 gpus time yes need use gpu render software use 8 gpus one system one license every additional gpu speed render time lot render 3d sims new cpu run 2 gpus run 8x cause share 16x leave 4 full pcie40 lane system drive deal breaker increase speed overall well worth one thing everybody aware new intel chip p core e core something old cpu ecores severely impact certain software performance boot new machine try ableton daw first time expect happy performance boost software literally almost unusable ecores slow software bad could barely change setting preference bad install process lasso fantastic software free never heard disable use ecores ableton work fast great,2,positive,"{'resolve': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3818}, 'increase': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'play': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.34}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'crazy': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}, 'problem': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'number': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0772}, 'allow': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'yes': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'share': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.296}, 'leave': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.0516}, 'well': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'worth': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'severely': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4588}, 'certain': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'happy': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5719}, 'boost': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'bad': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423}, 'fantastic': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5574}, 'free': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5106}, 'great': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.6249}}",2,2

I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.

336,5,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers‚ÄîBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans‚ÄîAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse‚Äîachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40¬∞C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50¬∞C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods‚Äîincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date‚Äî4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen.

337,5,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1.

It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.

I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly.

The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution.

I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.)I called Intel tech support who was less than help full. I updated all drivers and still didn't work.I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell.

I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Now, this review isn‚Äôt about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you‚Äôre only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc‚Ä¶. Then this is the right cpu for you. I‚Äôm able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I‚Äôm able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesn‚Äôt break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldn‚Äôt work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasn‚Äôt an issue BUT sometimes it‚Äôs just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and that‚Äôs what ddr5 has done for me. I‚Äôve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu I‚Äôve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasn‚Äôt disappointed.

512,5,"Cinebench R23 scores: 40,345 MT / 2,284 STUpgrading from the Ryzen 5950X, this processor has some significant uplift, particularly in the single-core speed. Minimal overclocking headroom as Intel has already milked 90% of the performance on stock settings. However, with some tweaking, you're likely to get up to 6.2 Ghz boost behavior for single-core loads, and bump up the all-core boost to 5.7 Ghz (up from 5.5 Ghz stock). With some further tweaking of the voltage-frequency curve, you could probably tweak this even further. I'm not a big fan of all-core overclocks on these type of processors, as you will lose the boosting single-core speed. In my opinion, this processor shines for gaming because of its single-core boosting performance.Memory controller has been significantly improved over Alder Lake. I was easily able to get my DDR5 6400 XMP profile running without any tweaking. I'm pretty sure this can be easily pushed further, but it seems like around 6400 Mhz memory is the roughly the sweet spot in terms of price vs performance.Very power hungry, but despite the bad reputation from reviewers, the power consumption can be easily tamed. If you run power limits unlocked, you will likely be thermal limited due to thermal throttling at 100c. However, you don't need unlocked power limits - you're talking about a very small 5-10% performance uplift but using >100W more power to achieve this. I would suggest running it at stock power limits, or unlocked power limits but seriously consider undervolting.On a final note, I wouldn't consider getting the rumored 6.0 Ghz version of the 13900K in the future. The current 13900K can easily be pushed to >6 Ghz boost speeds and will save you money.",cinebench r23 score 40345 mt 2284 stupgrading ryzen 5950x processor significant uplift particularly singlecore speed minimal overclocking headroom intel already milked 90 performance stock setting however tweak youre likely get 62 ghz boost behavior singlecore load bump allcore boost 57 ghz 55 ghz stock tweak voltagefrequency curve could probably tweak even im big fan allcore overclocks type processor lose boost singlecore speed opinion processor shine game singlecore boost performancememory controller significantly improve alder lake easily able get ddr5 6400 xmp profile run without tweak im pretty sure easily push seem like around 6400 mhz memory roughly sweet spot term price v performancevery power hungry despite bad reputation reviewer power consumption easily tame run power limit unlocked likely thermal limited due thermal throttle 100c however dont need unlocked power limit youre talk small 510 performance uplift use 100w power achieve would suggest run stock power limit unlocked power limit seriously consider undervoltingon final note wouldnt consider get rumor 60 ghz version 13900k future current 13900k easily push 6 ghz boost speed save money,2,positive,"{'significant': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2023}, 'boost': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'fan': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'lose': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'improve': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4404}, 'easily': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.34}, 'pretty': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4939}, 'sure': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'sweet': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4588}, 'bad': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423}, 'limited': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}, 'seriously': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1779}, 'save': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4939}}",2,2
513,5,"i upgraded from 5900xt. I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I ‚Äòve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldn‚Äôt justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu.my use case is productivity. i‚Äôm a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. It‚Äôs pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable.Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean it‚Äôs fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30‚Äôs. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right.About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5.Price: For 570 it‚Äôs decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700.I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade.Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. don‚Äôt worry about the vrm. that‚Äôs also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get.",upgraded 5900xt get msi board z690 159 13900kf want cpu igpu year couldnt justify price increase gpu version actually use dgpu really convenient use accelerate work judge im use work productivity game would spend 200 game cpumy use case productivity im developer sole reason upgraded fight window freeze slow lot workflow use wsl intellj docker react apps java etc often time pretty noticeable improvement really help like could use ddr4 since board 150 acceptableheat cpu get bad reputation due heat wattage put bucket frankly amd get well mean fine use much power need maximize perf limited cpu 250w run d15 cooler 5900 full load get high 80c work 30 lose little perf run zone dont know board msi one sure make easy price rightabout cpu ton core didnt need buy ddr5 need quite lot ram still cost much benefit provide workload memory controller 13gen far well ryzen 5000 series couldnt get ddr4 stable 4000 5900x intel one immediately indeed even able tighten timing touch modern processor id assume amd one well make welcome improvement memory support id say dont need much ram say 32gb dont ddr4 already tide id consider get ddr5 though mean nothing cheaper 4k speed fine nothing maybe old ram id go w ddr5price 570 decent deal love spending get lot well amd offering time write 700i wish intel support board reuse line even overblown extent extent though sell feature frankly reuse really think dont understand intel stubborn subject amd cpu go 2700x 5900x board go 470 570 wan io well pcie also give board kid upgraded one time intel especially mean buy cheap board anyway upgrade ton feature get add half time usually try spend 150 board though get harder would preference really onboard 600 motherboards 300 one inbetween guess thats equally unappealing esp w upgradetipsa rant trust msi board 159 amaze really work great dont worry vrm thats also overblown go calculate amperage come close also msi great brand bios easy navigate want fancy audio buy dac reuse plug usb keep reuse think really need msi board nice selection pcie slot well place nvme use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro encode small one amd one 6900 bought 570 game really love layout connectivity feature board cut stuff dont need par cpu together 700 cpu board pretty much good get,2,positive,"{'want': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0772}, 'increase': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'fight': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}, 'freeze': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0516}, 'pretty': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4939}, 'improvement': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4588}, 'help': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'bad': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423}, 'well': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'fine': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2023}, 'limited': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263}, 'lose': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'sure': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'easy': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4404}, 'benefit': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4588}, 'stable': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.296}, 'welcome': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4588}, 'support': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'love': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.6369}, 'wish': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4019}, 'stubborn': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019}, 'rant': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}, 'trust': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5106}, 'amaze': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5423}, 'great': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.6249}, 'worry': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4404}, 'nice': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4215}, 'cut': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2732}, 'good': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4404}}",2,2

518,4,"Concerning Intel Core i9-13900KF,I have this CPU with board ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi 6E LGA 1700 for gaming usage.  Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare.I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering.FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.

It is the perfect CPU for me, but also for those who do intensive work loads, such as running running large data models for AI purposes.My particular use case for this CPU was to allow me to build a virtual lab to which I could analyse malware in an virtual sandbox, whilst also emulating real world hacking attacks. At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature.My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years.",instal cpu month ago alongside 64gb ram asus tuf game motherboardthe tldr lighten quick super easy install cpu care take instal handle cpu relatively straight forwardall say cpu beast like overkill average user game overkill perfect cpu also intensive work load run run large data model ai purposesmy particular use case cpu allow build virtual lab could analyse malware virtual sandbox whilst also emulate real world hack attack present able run several virtual machine performance issue probably imagine power hungry beast get warm adequate cool solution issue keep pc nice cool pair cpu aio also additional fan case ensure lot air flow ensure thermal good temperaturemy advice anybody purchasing cpu go well worth investment time youll future proof soon beast machine next 10 year,2,positive,"{'super': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5994}, 'easy': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4404}, 'care': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4939}, 'straight': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'like': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'perfect': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5719}, 'allow': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'attack': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767}, 'warm': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'adequate': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}, 'cool': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'solution': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'nice': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4215}, 'fan': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'ensure': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3818}, 'good': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4404}, 'well': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'worth': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2263}}",2,2

625,4,"The best processor in 2022-2023 for those who want to both video games and to work. Unfortunately also with undervolting as efficiency is a disaster, in gaming comes to consume 3-4 times more than it should.When I watch a movie, the maximum frequency to me by consuming 25-30 Watt in Idle or almost, I had to bang me to make personalized energy profiles with QuickCpu to have acceptable consumption, but they are still uncomfortable to change for eachGame and application, even with PowerPlanswitcher. The fault is also of Windows that does not help, because it does not climb the frequency based on consumption. Then I have also noticed that Windows prefers to use the p-cores HT rather than the e-coresBy increasing the inefficiency and thus also causing the drops in performance since logical cores are much less powerful than efficient cores. As overclocking there is nothing to do, the best to stay in PL2 and Tmax 90 ¬∞ in full is 5.8GHzOut of 2-3 cores, 5.7GHz out of 7 cores and 5.5ghz on all P-cores, however setting it thus becomes more inefficient coi processes that require less cores. I noticed that the CPU has a 5.3ghz Sweet spot in which the performance, efficiency and temperatures are much better, so one of the power plans that I did with Quickcpu limits the clock to this frequency. The most positive thing is that compared to AMD it is possible to overclock the memory and increase the performance of 10-15% in the apps and in the games that use so much and thus making the CPU becomes more efficient since the memories consume a few watts and speed up computational performance and the difference with the 3D Vcache of AMD is filled in the applications in which it hasThe best.

However, a closer examination reveals that this processor falls short of delivering the expected value for its price tag.At first glance, the i9-14900KS appears promising, with its high clock speeds and purported performance enhancements. However, when put to the test, it becomes evident that the marginal improvements over its predecessors do not justify the hefty price premium attached to it.One of the major drawbacks of the i9-14900KS is its lackluster performance gains in real-world scenarios. Despite the incremental upgrades in clock speeds and architecture, users may find that the difference in performance compared to previous generations is negligible in most tasks, from gaming to content creation.Moreover, the i9-14900KS faces stiff competition from rival processors, such as those from AMD's Ryzen lineup, which offer comparable performance at a more reasonable price point. In terms of value for money, the i9-14900KS simply does not measure up, as consumers can find better alternatives that provide similar or even superior performance without breaking the bank.Furthermore, the i9-14900KS's power consumption and thermal management remain areas of concern. Despite being marketed as a high-performance processor, it tends to run hot under heavy workloads, requiring robust cooling solutions to prevent thermal throttling and maintain stable operation.In conclusion, while the Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor may appeal to enthusiasts seeking the latest and greatest hardware, its lack of significant performance improvements and unfavorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a hard sell for the average consumer.

797,3,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU.

We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.

After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.

The i7 4770k was still capable, but honestly I wanted RCPS3 to run better because their getting closer to 75% of the library being playable. Also, I could tell my 8gb of g-skill sniper ram was holding me back and i could not for the life of me find 16gb of ram available that would run with trusted compatibility with my current board. The i9 12900kf hardly touches 20% usage for any new game and older games are even less usage while the video card sits at 99-100% usage, this is the sweet spot for no bottle necking and high performance.The video card is an RTX 2060 Super @ 1440P on Dell's 32"" monitor S3220DGF. With zero brightness and contrast at a hundred, the colors pop. I'd say comparable to OLED with those settings or at least IPS. The CPU is paired with the Z690 Strix motherboard and 32gb of Corsair vengeance ram. 32gb is the sweet spot. I watched a Linus Tech Tip video that said 8gb is good enough but when I run MSI afterburner along with Riva Tuner-statistics , the ram usage is usually between 10 and 12gb's used and sometimes as high as 14gb, with no known programs of mine running in the background. Perhaps we definitely passed the 8gb minimum by now.

1039,5,"Previously I had the AMD 7950x and it was pretty fast, don‚Äôt get me wrong. However, this 13900ks is a lot snappier even browsing around in windows 11. Programs launch faster and games are buttery smooth @ 4k ultra details, when paired with an Nvidia 4090. I also love the fact that the ks is a ‚Äúbinned‚Äù CPU, which overclocks more easily and typically handles faster DDR5 memory in the range of 7800-8400Mhz depending on how good the memory controller is in your 13900ks sample. Regardless, you will probably be able to hit 7800-8000 at the least. This purchase is actually my 2nd 13900ks and I ended up getting a better binned version this time. With an overal(Asus) SP of 113, P Cores 123, e cores 93, and memory controller was 83. Im currently running a G.Skill 32GB(2x16GB) 7800mhz DDR5 kit with XMP turned on in the BIOS. I have been able to bump it up to a stable 8000mhz by bumping up the Memory Controller voltage to 1.4v and the VDD/VDDQ voltage to 1.5v using the same timings that were on my 7800 XMP kit CL36. With the CPU and a Corsair h170i 420mm AIO with 6 fans in a push pull configuration, I was able to get a stable CPU overclock of 60/60/58/58/58/58/58/58 on the (8) P cores, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I can bump the 1-3 core workloads higher. It‚Äôs when using a workload that requires all 8 P cores that I run into some stability issues with my current cooling trying to push it past 5.8Ghz using all 8 p cores. I leave my E cores all synced at 4.3Ghz stock to help give me more P core Overclock headroom. Another overclock method that works really well, is easy and stable, is to turn on the Asus AiOverclock. Given that I have used both an MSI and Asus Z790 motherboard, I highly recommend the Asus ROG brand line for a Z790 compatible motherboard for this 13900ks. They update their BIOS version frequently and there quality is typically very good on there products that are produced in higher numbers. The absolute ideal motherboard for Overclocking and using the fastest DDR5 ram would be the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX(2-DIMM) motherboard. If you just can‚Äôt get your hands on one maybe go with the (4-DIMM) Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero motherboard. You should be able to reach up to 7600mhz DDR5 on it. Whatever you do don‚Äôt settle on a motherboard, because it‚Äôs the center of the system and can be upgraded later. I started with an MSI Meg Z790 Ace and wish I had started with an Asus. The MSI ran a lot hotter with the same clock speeds and only supported up to 7200mhz DDR5 using 2x16GB sticks. The motherboard attached in the review photo is the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX, a thermal Grizzly 12/13th gen contact frame to make the cpu more level for the heatsink cooler that goes on top and of course the 13900ks that‚Äôs a little dirty from previously applied thermal paste I just wiped off.

1048,5,"Works just fine, really fast, lots of cores.  With all the cores running, they will run up to 100 C and throttle back on clock speed with pretty much any standard CPU cooler.  The consensus seems to be that this is limited by the thermal connection inside the CPU case between the actual chip and the upper surface which contacts your cooling block.  In other words, the cores can overheat even if your cooling system can maintain the upper surface of the CPU at room temperature.  You don't want the cores running hot at 99 C for any length of time, and so you really need to tune the CPU clock speed and the voltages with a motherboard that permits overclock tuning.
