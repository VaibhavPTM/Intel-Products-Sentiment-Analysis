I think it's mission accomplished.Reading movies, or while listening to music, the Intel processor and the graphics card (GTX 1660 Ti) do not each exceed 35 ¬∞ C, and climb respectively at 47 ¬∞ C and 62 ¬∞ C during the game sessions.I specifies that the 12100F is cooled by a low profile nightua NHL-12S fan, supported by an Arctic P12 fan, and is fixed in the socket by an adjustment frame, supposed to avoid deformations of the processor surface, of thermalright brand. In the end of power, this processor can be associated with any graphics card without limiting the potential of the latter, except perhaps those above the very powerful AMD RX 6900 XT and RTX 3080 Ti.On the other hand, the Intel will fish a little without being ridiculous.Know that it has as much responding as a high -end of 4 years ago.

114,5,"The Intel Core i3-12100 processor from the 12th generation brings a breath of fresh air to compact NAS systems.As an entry-level chip of the current Alder Lake architecture, it not only offers sufficient computing power for demanding server tasks, but also convinces with a very efficient energy balance. The modern hybrid design made of four performance and four efficiency corses enables always balanced operation.Demanding tasks such as video transcoding, multitasking or containerization are mastered via the fast P-cores with a high clock rate.For less complex background processes, the electricity-saving e-cores take over the job. With boost cyclists up to 4.3 GHz from the box, the i3-12100 offers enormous performance reserves for arithmetic-intensive NAS workloads such as video streaming, multimediaservices or data backup tasks.The modern Skylake architecture and 12MB intelligent cache accelerate the data sets.This significantly reduces the operating costs and noise pollution of the NAS.

277,5,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),ive own expensive cpu amd ryzen 9 intel 13900k case overkill ran hot high wattage work offload everything gpu beastly cpu wasteive downgrade cpu main desktop rig great productivity software music design work well game pair rtx 4000 series card havent notice significant drop frame rate whilst game maybe 15 fps game max monitor 144hzfps 1440pone different thing cpu intel offering 6 performance core 12 thread hyperthreading low power efficiency core really need laptop anyway save battery powerthe cpu also efficient run quite cool mine 26c idle 2630 light task browsing web game temp usually mid 50 benchmarking cinebench geekbench etc reach mid 60 use twofan deepcool as500 plus air cooler three case 120mm fansall happy purchase highly recommend,2,positive,"{'rig': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.128}, 'great': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.6249}, 'well': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2732}, 'significant': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.2023}, 'drop': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2732}, 'low': {'neg': 1.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2732}, 'efficiency': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}, 'save': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4939}, 'efficient': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.4215}, 'cool': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3182}, 'reach': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.0258}, 'happy': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.5719}, 'recommend': {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 1.0, 'compound': 0.3612}}",2,2

However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender.

This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.

is a technology in which the CPU operator (recently 256 to 512 -bit) is subdivided into a variable type (8-64bit), and the calculation is parallel.AVX256 calculates 8 -bit variables in 32 parallel, but AVX512 can calculate in 64 parallel.The recent performance of the CPU is almost determined by the speed of the AVX instruction.In particular, the speed of the video encoding and generated AI appears in the superiority of the AVX instruction.Intel has a fast AVX order since Haswell Refresh (4th generation), and is strong in video conversion, and when idle is about 700MHz (Ryzen is about 1.4GHz at most), it is good to have high power saving performance.hey.However, if the power limit does not work at all, it will have a hard time cooling.The CPU cooler for TDP65W drops to about 3.0GHz with the thermal slot ring.Still, it is a big deal because the above performance comes out.If you attach a fine CPU cooler, it will always move around 4.0GHz.This is the second generation of P-CORE (single performance specialization) and E-Core (efficiency / multi-performance), which are good at Intel, who makes a wide range of CPUs from ATOM to Xeon.The production process (NM value) tends to be delayed to AMD and ARM, but I think Intel is still excellent in architecture and instruction sets.If you switch from the Tiger Lake (11th generation) below, the performance is not a dream, so you are amazed at the advancement of technology.The built -in GPU is 32 executed units (80 i5 1135g7 of Tiger Lake), so it should be divisible as a bonus.If you are willing to play a little game, add the

I put my old Nvidia GTS 250 in it and it was insane (goes to show you I've only used crappy computers through my life).Also, I had nightmares about fan noise (that's how loud my first desktop was). I played flying games on my old desktop and the stock cooler fan sounded like a jet engine so I always had to have my headphones with music or games playing to drown it out. Because of this, I was going to buy an after market fan but once I started it up, it was very quiet. I was surprised!

It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web.
